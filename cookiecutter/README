Pythonâ„¢ logo cookie cutter for your 3D printer!

The logo is a trademark of the Python Software Foundation.
If you use it, be sure to follow the guidelines at:
https://www.python.org/community/logos/

In particular, please contact the PSF if you wish to sell
anything derived from the logo (or from these files).

Anyway, I'm not a lawyer, but I'm pretty sure giving these
(or the cookies!) out at your local meetup Python meetup
whould be pretty awesome!
